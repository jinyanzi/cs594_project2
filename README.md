# cs594_project2

Project 2 for CS 594 (Advanced Machine Learning), 2016 Fall

Here we mainly study the depth and width property of deep neural network on image recognition task.
The two papers we are working on is 
  1. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
  2. Wide Residual Networks
  
Base code are from
  1. https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch.git
  2. https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks.git
